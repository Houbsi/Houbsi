# Hi there 👋

Welcome to my little coding world. 

## 🔭

I’m currently working on my own “Townhouse” Project. It was for a long time a private hidden project. But now i want to start with it as an open source project on GitHub.

## 🌱

I’m currently learning for work the Azure Data Factory and Azure Biztalk and the whole Azure DevOps Environment.

For my own “pleasure” I’m currently studying for my B.o.Sc. in informatics economics, so that i have work experience in those fields and some official paper with it on.
